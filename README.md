# LenovoLegionToolkit-NET10-Rollforward

This project is a simple fork of the BartoszCichecki's LenovoLegionToolkit version 2.26.1; Which is EOL.
The only difference is it is built with NET 10 with roll forward enabled for future .NET Desktop Runtime releases without needing a recompile.

Please note there do exist successor forks, but if you do not trust the changes in those, this will be a good alternative.
